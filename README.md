# Mini DIT Prototype (GSoC 2026 Prep)

⚠️ This is a **1-week experimental prototype**, built as part of my GSoC 2026 preparation.

This repository is **forked from StabilityNexus/IdentityTokens-EVM-Contracts** and is **not a production-ready implementation**.

## Goal
To explore the design and security trade-offs of **Decentralized Identity Tokens (DIT)**, inspired by:
- TNT (Trust Network Tokens)
- VouchMe (On-chain testimonials)

## Scope (Intentionally Small)
- ERC-721 based self-issued identity tokens
- Optional identity metadata (name, links, age group, etc.)
- On-chain endorsements between identity tokens
- Revocable endorsements
- Basic compromise / revocation signals (exploratory)

## Non-Goals
- Full DID standard compliance
- Off-chain attestations
- ZK / privacy guarantees (future work)

## Status
🚧 Work in progress (1-week learning prototype)

## Relation to GSoC 2026
This project aligns with the proposed **Decentralized Identity Tokens (DIT)** direction and is intended purely as a learning and exploration exercise before the proposal phase.
